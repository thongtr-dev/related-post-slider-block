A truly WYSIWYG, responsive and dynamic related post carousel slider Gutenberg block.

== Description ==

Upon activating this plugin, you will not see any new menu page inside WP admin dashboard. Instead, this plugin adds a dynamic block straight to the block editor. You can then use the block settings sidebar to customize and edit everything related to the block.

This block picks the posts that have the same category/categories of the current post and display them in a carousel slider.

To insert and use the block, inside the post editor, underneath the main post content (or any position you wish), type '/related', you should see the block called 'Related Post Slider Block'. Choose and insert it to the post editor.

Here are the controls that you can customize and edit:
✅ Display controls:
    - Toggle on/off featured image for each slide.
    - Toggle on/off category badge for each slide.
    - Toggle on/off meta info(author, published date) for each slide.
    - Toggle on/off excerpt for each slide.
    - Display slide items in ASC/DESC order.
    - Number of total posts to display.
    - Number of posts per slide.
✅ Responsive controls (desktop, tablet, mobile).
✅ Dimension controls:
    - Carousel padding/margin
    - Slide item padding/margin

    - Slide item border control
    - Slide item border radius control
    - Slide item box shadow control
